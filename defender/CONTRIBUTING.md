## Contributing code
If you want to contribute your code, the best way to submit a patch is to send a pull request.  

Here are the steps of a typical workflow.

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a topic branch with a descriptive name.
4. Make changes with unit tests in the topic branch.
5. Push commits to your fork on GitHub.
6. Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

For steps 1 to 3, please read [this GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) if you are not familiar with these operations. 
Step 4 and 5 are basic [git](http://git-scm.com/) operations. Please see the [online documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation) for its usage.

For how to write a unit test, please see the [unit test](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/wiki/Unit-Test) page.
